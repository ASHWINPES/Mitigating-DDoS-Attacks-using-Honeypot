# Mitigating-DDoS-Attacks-using-Honeypot
Final year project


Effects of DDoS are but not limited to Loss of reputation and Loss of credit which are main concerns. From an industry perspective, all small sized, medium sized and large sized industries are if not in large but get impacted by DDoS Attacks due to exploitation of their resources and not available for genuine use. From a research perspective, storage of old data is required for DDoS mitigation to learn from the patterns of the old attacks on the system. Implementing honeypots in a business environment may benefit the business in two ways. Firstly, it can provide some form of defense to the real system. The attacker may be diverted away from the actual system into the honeypot. Secondly, the lessons learned from the attacks can be used to build even better defense mechanisms.
